## About
This is my own Qtile config, clone it and customize it in your own way. This config was forked and modified from DistroTube. 

Make sure to set your preferred mod key in config.py in there you will also find a set of variables to set your default applications.

For easy access to the Qtile config you can add the following line of code to your `.bashrc / .zshrc`

    alias qtile-config=<your editor> ~/config/qtile/config.py
